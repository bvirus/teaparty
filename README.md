# teaparty
A collaboration tool for literary magazines



## Development instructions

### General tools

First, install `node.js` via your normal package manager. On Windows, I'd recommend doing everything under WSL Ubuntu 20.04.

Then, install `yarn` with 
```
$ sudo npm install -g yarn
```

Then, run `yarn install` in the root directory. This will install all of the packages.

### VSCode Setup

Assuming you have the default typescript package installed, make sure to open the project from the root `teaparty/` folder, **NOT** the `frontend/`, `backend/`, or `/shared` folders. Otherwise it should just work!

### Running the frontend

`cd` into the `frontend/` directory and run `yarn start`.
