A collaboration tool for literary magazines

## Development instructions

### General tools

First, install `node.js` via your normal package manager. On Windows, I'd recommend doing everything under WSL Ubuntu 20.04.

Then, install `yarn` with 
```
$ sudo npm install -g yarn
```

Then, run `yarn install` in the root directory. This will install all of the packages.

### Run App in Development Mode

``` 
$ yarn run dev
```

### Run Tests

```
$ yarn test
```
